Welcome to the OrbitX API Reference.

There are two ways to build API documentation: OpenAPI and MDX components. For this documentation, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

[View the OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/orbitx/api-reference/openapi.json)

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
